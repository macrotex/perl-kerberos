/*
 * Portability wrapper around krb5.h.
 *
 * This header includes krb5.h and then adjusts for various portability
 * issues, primarily between MIT Kerberos and Heimdal, so that code can be
 * written to a consistent API.
 *
 * Unfortunately, due to the nature of the differences between MIT Kerberos
 * and Heimdal, it's not possible to write code to either one of the APIs and
 * adjust for the other one.  In general, this header tries to make available
 * the Heimdal API and fix it for MIT Kerberos, but there are places where MIT
 * Kerberos requires a more specific call.  For those cases, it provides the
 * most specific interface.
 *
 * For example, MIT Kerberos has krb5_free_unparsed_name() whereas Heimdal
 * prefers the generic krb5_xfree().  In this case, this header provides
 * krb5_free_unparsed_name() for both APIs since it's the most specific call.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
 * which can be found at <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.
