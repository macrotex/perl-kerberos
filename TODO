                       Authen::Kerberos To-Do List

 * Implement enough of the Kerberos API to support the kstart test suite
   without needing to run external programs.

 * Name the modules according to whether they were built with MIT or
   Heimdal and provide wrapper modules that loads the appropriate
   underling binary module.  Then, support co-installation of the MIT and
   Heimdal versions and selection at runtime.

 * Add support for the rest of the kadmin API.

 * Figure out a good way of exposing the Kerberos error codes.  After this
   has been done, document the error codes in chpass exceptions that
   correspond to password quality checking failures.
