The keytab files in this directory were created via the kadmin ktadd
command using an MIT Kerberos implementation and a test Kerberos realm
named test-k5.stanford.edu.

If recreated, the contents will be different, since different random keys
will be chosen and the timestamps will be newer.  This will require
changes to the test cases to check for different data.
