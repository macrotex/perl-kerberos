The heimdal.db file here was created with the following commands:

    kadmin -c kdc.conf -l init TEST.EXAMPLE.COM
    kadmin -c kdc.conf -l add --random-password test

and accepting all of the defaults.  If recreated, the contents will be
different, since different random keys will be chosen, but the files
should serve equally well for test purposes.
